    "I will construct histograms per category of relationship status, previously married/widowed, married, single, or currently dating/engaged. Time spent with friends (CONNECTION_social_time_friends_p7d_grouped) will be quantified along the x-axis and how often people fall under the category will be quantified along the y-axis. This can visualize the amount of time spent with friends depending on the different relationship status categories. The peaks and skews of each histogram will vary in location depending on how often they spend time with friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis/Results and Discussion**  \n",
    "Those that are either single or in relationships but not yet married spend the most time with their friends as they might either be looking to find a partner or are not yet in a position to be settled down yet, hence spending more time out with friends. Those married are more focused on family, meaning less time spent with friends, and those previously married/widowed are in between. The peaks will all be at different values."

    "I think that the data points will have a slightly positive slope, since with age, we get more comfortable in our society. This ties into being comfortable with interacting with other members of our communities, even if we may not know them."
